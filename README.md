# SpeedGolf
A mini golf speed based game with self-made pixel art graphics and GUI. Made in Unity2D using C# for iOS and Android Devices; however, is also compatible with MacOS and Desktop Devices using click and drag. Created initially in 2021 over the span of 4 months for my Senior Capstone Project, but was later further refined.
